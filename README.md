## Background Description

This website has been built for a xxxxxxx as part of a marketing campaign to :<br>

* 

## 1. UX

I produced a Planes Analysis before starting the project, which sets out the purpose and objectives of the project. This document can be read here :

 * [ML Bowen Planes Analysis](https://github.com/KieronOC/CI-MP1/blob/master/background_work/Planes%20Analysis-ML%20Bowen%20Website.pdf)

I also constructed a basic wireframe document prior to starting to write the code, which can be read here :

 * [ML Bowen Wireframe](https://github.com/KieronOC/CI-MP1/blob/master/background_work/ML%20Bowen%20Wireframe%20200608.pdf)

There is more work to do on making sure the sight is accessible for all potential users which requires greater knowledge and skills than I have at present. I have used alt image tags and headings wherever possible. 

## 2. Features

> ### 2.1 Existing Features
>The site is a basic information site for people landing on it from a;
>* Web Search
>* Social Media link
>* Direct entry
>
> The overidding aim being to encourage a user to call the therapist directly or gain sufficient information quickly and easily and then call. Therefore the main features comprise :
>* 6 pages that allow the user to find out more about the treatment and about the therapist.
>* Call or email the therapist by clicking on the phone number.
>* Fill out a contact form (which is not yet functional).
>* Each page has been reduced to the minimum amount of text possible that conveys the most important details. An accordian solution has been sued to allow the user to open up greater levels of information as they choose on the pages where this is relevant.

> ### 2.2 Features Left to Implement
>
> As per the Planes analysis above there are features left to implement once I have the necessary skills as follows :
>
>The most immediate next steps are to:
>
> * Learn and write the code to make the contact form live.
> * Write a GDPR statement and opt out buttons in line with the form submission.
> * Put the website up on a hosted site with an SSL Certificate. 
>
>Thereafter the following are the principle features the cient would like to explore implementing:
>
> 1. Bigger technical reference section with body diagrams and treatment photos.
> 2. Ability for customers to post comments and testimonials directly.
> 3. Calendar facility to allow direct booking of appointments.
> 4. Payment facility to take payment at the time of making a booking.

## 3. Technologies Used

| No. 	| Code Area 	| Code Source 	| Comment 	|
|-----	|-----------	|-------------	|---------	|
| 1.  	|Bootstrap 4          	| www.bootstrap.com	            	|For layout and styling.         	|
| 2.  	|Fontawesome          	|www.fontaweseome.com         	|For Social media logos.         	|
| 3.  	|HTML          	|	             	|Main language used.         	|
| 4.  	|CSS          	|             	|For overriding Bootstrap and creating specific styles.         	|
| 5.    |Google Fonts|https://developers.google.com/fonts|Fonts but not used specifically.|

<br>

## 4. Testing

### <u>Code Validation</u>
I have put all the HTML and CSS through the W3C Markup validation service at https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input.

All errors detected have been corrected except those that can't be sorted yet such as the empty form action attribute.

### <u>Browser Validation</u>

I have loaded the site via the GitHub URL (https://kieronoc.github.io/CI-MP1/) onto :

* Microsoft Edge
* Google Chrome
* Firefox

The website appears to work on all these platforms without any issues, including re-sizing.

I have also reviewed the website on:

* Iphone 6
* Ipad
* Widescreen desktop
* Laptop

The site functionality appears to be OK on all these platforms with the logo image changing on the phone screen sizes.

The form fields are not connected as yet as I do not have that knowledge yet, but trying to submitt without required fields being entered produces the necessary user message.


### <u>Performance Test</u>

I ran a performance test at gtmetrix.com with the following result : https://gtmetrix.com/reports/kieronoc.github.io/PG2MMO0C 

Suggestions in this report will need more knowledge to implement but it seems there are no glaring problems at this stage.

## 5. Deployment

I have pushed all the code to GITHUB and have published the main branch (there is only a main branch) at https://kieronoc.github.io/CI-MP1/.

For the time being the social media links are direct at the BBC News website.

This link opens the website from all the devices I have tested it on.


## 6. Credits

I have put specific citations in notes in the index.html file that show where specific learning was obtained to be able to write the code. Similarly on other pages where it applies. Except where noted all the code was written from scratch with the only 'copied and pasted'code being the Code Institute template and the CDN Scripts for Bootstrap, Fontawesome and Google Fonts.<br><br>

More specific references are noted in the code.         	|
| 2.  	|Bootstrap         	|https://getbootstrap.com             	|To learn how to use the code attributes and understand how they worked and could be applied.         	|
